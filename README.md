# MuJoCo-rs
MuJoCo bindings for Rust

## Installation requirements
These bindings require that MuJoCo be installed before building.  The build system assumes that MuJoCo is installed into /usr/local, but any installation directory can be used, as long as either the environment variable MUJOCO_DIR or MUJOCO_PREFIX is set to the root of the installation.
